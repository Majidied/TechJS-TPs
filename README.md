## 🚀 How to Use

### Running the Projects

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Majidied/TechJS-TPs.git
   cd TechJS-TPs
   ```

2. **Open a TP:**
   - Navigate to the desired TP folder (functions/ or objectsLoops/)
   - Open the HTML file in your web browser

3. **For Functions TP (Rock Paper Scissors):**
   ```bash
   # Open in browser
   start functions/functions2-r-s-p.html
   ```

4. **For Objects & Loops TP (Todo List):**
   ```bash
   # Open in browser
   start objectsLoops/todo-list.html
   ```

### No Installation Required
All projects are pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript and run directly in the browser. No dependencies or build tools needed!
